# ManualReviewClassifier
Manual Non-Functional Requirements Review Classification Tool


This tool allows a user to classify reviews into 4 Non-functional Requirements categories (Dependability, Performance, Supportability, and Usability). The user can select the folder containing reviews and corresponding labels. The reviews file should be named "Reviews.txt" and the label file should be named "ReviewLabels.txt". Each line is a single review in the "Reviews.txt" file and the corresponding label is in the same line number of the "ReviewLabels.txt" file.
