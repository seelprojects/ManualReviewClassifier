# ManualReviewClassifier
Manual Non-Functional Requirements Review Classification Tool


This tool was used to aid our subjects in their manual classification of NFRs in app user reviews. Multiple labels can be selected for a single review for multi-label tagging. If no label is selected then the label defaults to "Mis" (Miscellaneous).
